# SQL Strategy Branch
Branched from `angular-ctrl-with-routes`. The main difference is it now uses `/strategies/user_sql.js`. See `/modules/connection.js` to set your PostGRES DB connection string. You will find a basic `CREATE TABLE` query commented out in the strategy file.

You'll need the `pg` module as well (just run `npm install`)

`/models/user.js` is no longer needed at all.

## Branch Breakdown
* `master:` Original lecture code with jQuery, alt static file serving, Grunt, Mongoose/Mongo
* `angular-complete:` Angular and MongoDB version as shown to Iota cohort.
* `sql_strategy:` Replaces MongoDB with PostGRES for storage of user data. Maintains bcrypt functionality.
* `angular-controlled-login-intro` : Introduces Angular as the login handler. All server communication is handled in an Angular Controller and updates the route/page based on success or failure. Intended for an alternate intro lecture to Passport (as seen in angular-complete and sql_strategy).

# Express/Passport Lecture Starting File
Download and run 'npm install' before the lecture as prep. In this lecture, we will build out a user registration page and allow our users to log into our application. Once they are logged in, we will see information returned to us, specific to the user.


### Y's Notes

Must create db before using this package: use postico to create a table
(_then: update DBname in user_sql.js config object, and update DB in connectionstring in connection.js_)
